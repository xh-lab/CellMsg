CellMsg is a method for analyzing cell-cell communication mediated by ligand-receptor interactions. (i) The CellMsg method is a framework that accurately captures potential ligand-receptor interactions, thereby effectively inferring cell-cell communications (CCCs). (ii) The CellMsg method organizes ligand-receptor pairs into an adjacency matrix format, obtains protein features using iFeature, and performs feature extraction through GCNConv. This is followed by binary classification tasks using linear layers. Multiple layers of GCNConv with skip connections are added to ensure comprehensive node neighborhood information, avoiding issues like over-smoothing and gradient vanishing, thereby improving model accuracy. The overview figure of CellMsg is shown as follows.

The overview of CellMsg.  a. Ligand-Receptor Interaction Prediction, including Data Preprocessing and Ligand-Receptor Interaction Classification. The data preprocessing section extracts multimodal features of ligands and receptors to construct an initial feature matrix and constructs an adjacency matrix based on known associations of ligands and receptors. The Ligand-Receptor Interaction Classification section uses these matrices as inputs to the graph convolutional networks to classify LRIs. b. Cell-Cell Communication Inference, including Ligand-Receptor Interaction Screening and Cell-Cell Communication Strength Measurement. The ligand-receptor interaction screening section filters high-confidence LRIs and then calculates the thresholding result, product result, and cell result for each scRNA-seq data. On this basis, the cell-cell communication strength measurement section uses a three-point estimation method to calculate the CCC strength between different cell types. c. Cell-Cell Communication Visualization, including the communication heatmap between different cell types, the communication network between different cell types, and the communication heatmap of the most active LR pairs between different cell types.

## 1, acquiring feature file from sequence file using iFeature
**Notes**: Since the processing steps for all sequence files are identical, we will proceed to process one of the sequence files.
```
python iFeature.py --file CellMsg/dataset1/ligand_sequence.txt --type AAC --out ligand_aac.csv
python iFeature.py --file CellMsg/dataset1/ligand_sequence.txt --type CKSAAP --out ligand_cksaap.csv
python iFeature.py --file CellMsg/dataset1/ligand_sequence.txt --type CTriad --out ligand_ctriad.csv
python iFeature.py --file CellMsg/dataset1/ligand_sequence.txt --type PAAC --out ligand_paac.csv
Then, the four features were merged to generate the final feature file for all ligands, where each row represents the features of one ligand, with the number of rows equating to the number of ligands.
```

## 2, training an LRI prediction model
**Notes**: Since the steps for training the LRI prediction model are the same for all datasets, let's proceed with processing Dataset 1.
```
python CellMsg/dataset1/CellMsg.py
```
## 3, preditcing LRIs using trained model
**Notes**: Since the steps for predicting LRIs are the same for all datasets, let's proceed with processing Dataset 1.
```
python CellMsg/dataset1/generate_lr.py
python CellMsg/dataset1/ensp_to_gname.py
```
Through the above steps, we obtained predicted LRIs with high confidence, which are then merged with the LRIs previously collected to serve as LRIs identified by CellMsg.

## 4, measuring cell-Cell communication strength
```
python CellMsg/CCC_Analysis/Processing_scRNA-seq_data.py
python CellMsg/CCC_Analysis/The_three-point_estimation_method.py
```
Through the above steps, we obtained the cell-cell communication strength matrix processed using the three-point evaluation method, and we generated the cell communication heatmap and cell communication network.

## 5, visualization analysis of cell-cell communication
```
python CellMsg/CCC_Analysis/The_number_of_LRIs.py
```
Through the steps outlined above, we have obtained Three_LRi_num.pdf and Three_LRi_num.csv, which show the number of LRIs mediating communication between cell types in human melanoma tissues.

```
python CellMsg/CCC_Analysis/Top.py
```
Through the above command, we obtained Top.pdf and Top_data.csv, which display the three most likely LR pairs mediating communication between melanoma cancer cells and six other cell types.
